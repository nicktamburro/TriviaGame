So I just wanted to thank you guys for everything so far. I really feel the support, so I thought of you guys as a kind of little coding bootcamp family.  With two dads. 

So Michael is like Extreme adventure dad, like, "hey kids, get in the car" and on the ride he's like "listen, I know you've never ridden a motorcycle, and I know that's not exactly legal yet," and the end of the day we're jumping motorcycles over schoolbuses and totally not wearing helmets.  

Ben is like the super unflappable dad, who can stay calm in any situation and keep everyone else calm too.  Ben's the one that's like "listen, I know the car is on fire and we're barreling off a cliff, is this a difficult problem? Yes, and that's okay! We just have to figure out what the next step is!""

Sammy is like the cool older brother who makes you mixtapes and will beat up bullies for you, and Theresa is the big sister who talks sense into you when you're being dumb, like "dude, just ask her to the dance!"

So basically, this is hard stuff, like jumping motorcycles and escaping certain death and asking people out, and the support you guys have offered has definitely kept me above water with this. My metaphors are hopelessly mixed by now. Sorry. Thanks!
